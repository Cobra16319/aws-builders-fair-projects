# Sample Project
The Sample Project description.

## Overview
This project contains sample code and a collection of AWS [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) templates intended to help you set up common pieces of AWS infrastructure. Each template defines a [stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks.html), which is a collection of related resources that can be created, updated, or deleted as a single unit.
